# Profile Image Upload Fix - TODO

## Issue: 500 Internal Server Error when uploading profile image for placement staff profiles

### Root Cause:
- Backend controller has improperly structured multer middleware
- Missing comprehensive error handling
- Potential profile creation issues before image upload

### Tasks to Complete:

## Backend Fixes:
- [x] Fix placementStaffProfileController.js uploadProfileImage function
  - [x] Restructure multer middleware implementation
  - [x] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - [x] Ensure profile exists before updating image URL
  - [x] Add proper file validation
  - [x] Improve error responses with meaningful messages

## Frontend Improvements:
- [x] Improve error handling in placementStaffProfileService.js
- [x] Better error management in PlacementStaffProfileContext.jsx
- [x] Add user-friendly error messages
- [x] Enhanced ProfileHeader.jsx with better UX and notifications

## Testing:
- [x] Test upload functionality with different file types
- [x] Verify error handling works correctly
- [x] Check Supabase storage configuration if needed

## Progress:
- [x] Analyzed codebase and identified root cause
- [x] Created comprehensive plan
- [x] Backend controller fixes (COMPLETED)
- [x] Frontend error handling improvements (COMPLETED)
- [x] Testing and validation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Fixed secondary profile save error (COMPLETED)

## Summary of Changes Made:

### Backend Fixes:
1. **Fixed multer middleware structure** - Changed from array export to proper middleware function
2. **Added comprehensive error handling** - Proper multer error handling with specific error messages
3. **Enhanced file validation** - Better file type and size validation with user-friendly messages
4. **Profile creation logic** - Ensures profile exists before image upload, creates if missing
5. **Detailed logging** - Added extensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Frontend Improvements:
1. **Enhanced service layer validation** - Client-side file validation before upload
2. **Better error handling** - Comprehensive error categorization and user-friendly messages
3. **Improved user experience** - Success/error notifications with Snackbar components
4. **Enhanced UI feedback** - Better loading states and tooltips
5. **Robust error recovery** - Proper error clearing and retry mechanisms
6. **Fixed duplicate save issue** - Removed redundant profile save call after image upload

## Final Fix Applied:
- **Root Issue**: The image upload was working correctly, but a secondary call to save the profile with just the profilePhotoUrl was causing a 500 error due to missing required fields when creating a new profile.
- **Solution**: Removed the redundant saveProfile call in the frontend since the backend upload function already updates the profile with the new image URL.
- **Result**: Image upload now works seamlessly without any errors. The profile is updated correctly and the image displays immediately.

## Additional Fix for Profile Update:
- **Secondary Issue**: Profile update from Basic Info form was failing due to validation mismatch between frontend data structure and backend validation expectations.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Created specific `validatePlacementStaffProfileUpdate` middleware that matches the frontend data structure (nested `name.firstName`, `name.lastName`, etc.)
  2. Updated the route to use the new validation middleware
  3. Fixed `profilePhotoUrl` validation to allow empty strings/null values
- **Result**: Both image upload and profile update now work correctly without any validation errors.

## Final Fix for User Model Compatibility:
- **Third Issue**: User model expects `department` as ObjectId but PlacementStaffProfile uses string codes like "CSE".
- **Solution**: Modified the controller to store department code in `departmentCode` field instead of `department` field when updating User model.
- **Result**: Profile updates now complete successfully without ObjectId casting errors.
